A personal implementation of PSO in C++ using Boost.

New Version! (complete rewrite).
========

Features:

1.  At last, you can multiple instances of Swarm with different evaluation callback fuctions ;)

2.  Replaced Vector.hpp with boost::numeric::ublas::vector<float> (typedef vecf).

3.  Using BOOST_FOREACH to reduce code where possible.

This is created for fun and a bit of need.
It is almost certain that there are more sophisticated and advanced vesions out there...


The final goal, is to merge with GeneticSoup and have new templated-framework-like for Memetic Algorithms.
